    now be much more portable
  - removed deprecated OSX font setting calls
  - texture properties are now returned by material3d()
  - allowed normals and texture coordinates to be specified in triangles, quads and surfaces

    open3d() does this.
  - minor fix for gcc 4.3 compatibility
  - minor fix for R 2.5+ compatibility
  - allowed more general surfaces to be plotted by rgl.surface, surface3d and

v0.82
  - rewrote internal rendering of transparent and anti-aliased shapes,
    so they will be rendered better when there are several in the same
    scene
  - added material properties "point_antialias", which causes points to be
    drawn as smooth circles, and "line_antialias", which causes
    lines to be antialiased.

    to be plotted in the wrong place.
  - fixed a bug in the Windows driver which caused the standard system
    font to disappear when justified.

    to points.
  - increased default point size to 3 pixels across.
  - fixed bug in open3d:  "..." was being ignored.
  - fixed bug in qmesh3d:  homogeneous=FALSE coordinates were not
    handled properly.
  - movie3d gains a "type" argument to set the output type, and the
    "convert" argument is more flexible.
  - rgl.snapshot() gives more informative error messages when libpng is
    not available.
  - axis3d() now uses format() rather than as.character() to give
    nicer looking labels.
  - the clipping volume calculation was incorrect when scaling was used.
  - use R warning() to report messages, rather than popups or REprintf.
  - added rgl.pixels() to read the generated image, and demo("stereo")
    to illustrate its use.
  - corrected the ?rgl example to display this file.

v0.83-1
  - Don't try to build Carbon driver in 64 bit Mac OS (contributed by
    Brian Ripley).
  - Fixed rgl.pixels example for weird displays.
  - Did not assume OpenGL 1.2 was available in material properties.

  - Fixed demo(stereo) to add sync in X11:  X windows seemed to grab
    images before they were redrawn.
  - Rearranged headers for Win64 compatibility (contributed by Alex
    Chen).

v0.83-3
  - Quick fix for R 2.9.x compatibility, and to remove accidental change
    introduced in v0.83 which caused errors on plotting without open3d().

v0.84
  - Added triangle meshes, shape lists, the Platonic solids and a cuboctahedron.
  - Added classes mesh3d and shapelist3d; qmesh3d is only kept for
    back compatibility.

    (Reported by Michael Friendly.)
  - Added R_ARCH* macros to configure.win for Win64 compatibility

  - Should now install using --merge-multiarch on Windows

v0.92.858
  - Added declarations for Solaris compatibility (from Brian Ripley)
  - Fixed configure.win for bi-arch compatibility.  Windows installers can
    set HAVE_PNG to a non-empty value, and rgl will look for
    the libpng files in the default LOCAL_SOFT location when installing.
  - Added depth_mask and depth_test material properties, to allow control
    over how objects are obscured by each other.
  - Added Sweave support through the rgl.Sweave driver and the Sweave.snapshot
    function.
  - Added iterative computation of the bounding box to handle objects like
    spheres, which need to maintain their apparent shape as the scaling
    changes.
  - Improved the bounding box decoration in two ways:  it can now draw the
    front faces (to surround the whole graph), and can label edges with pretty
    labels.  plot3d() was modified to use this instead of manually setting axis
    locations and using box3d() to draw a box, allowing resizeable labelled
    axes.
  - Removed some unnecessary declarations from rglmath.h that were causing
    problems in an old version of gcc on Solaris.
  - Added rgl.abclines(), rgl.planes(), abclines3d() and planes3d() to draw
    lines and planes intersecting with the bounding box.
  - rgl.postscript() now adjusts the size of text following the cex setting.
    The font and family settings are still ignored.
  - Transparency in material textures was not always rendered properly.
  - In OSX, the Carbon system has been replaced by a Cocoa system.
    (Code contributed by Adam Strzelecki).  For compatibility with the
    Windows build system, the new files have been put into src/osx.
  - Hardware antialiasing is now used if the OpenGL driver supports
    it.  Set options(rgl.antialias=0) to disable it.
  - Bug fix for divide.mesh3d() in handling normals.
  - Functions rgl.attrib.count() and rgl.attrib() (and internal function
    rgl.getmaterial()) added to allow objects in the scene to be examined.
  - rgl.ids() did not return all object ids as documented.
  - Updated gl2ps to version 1.3.6

v0.92.861
  - Fixed segfault on startup on Windows in MDI mode.
  - Added rgl.save.texture() to get texture from an object.

    browser.
  - Added "centers" to the attributes that can be queried, for depth sorted
    transparent rendering.

 v0.92.880

    windows.  (Contributed by Philip Johnson.)
  - Added code to work with R 3.0.0 setHook changes
  - Added selectpoints3d function to select points from the scene.
  - The rgl window now handles ESC key presses.  During selection
    and play3d they abort the process; otherwise they are ignored.
  - writeWebGL did not render semi-transparent surfaces properly.
    (Reported by Robert Esswein.)
  - Copied the R_pretty0 function from R sources to avoid warning.

v0.93.928
  - Updated the configure file using autoconf 2.69
  - Forced OSX installs to put /usr/X11/bin at the head of the path
    when looking for freetype-config

v0.93.930
  - writeWebGL did not handle snapshot=FALSE properly.  (Reported
    by Yihui Xie.)
  - Now handles local (not just directional) lighting.  Based on
    code contributed by Alexander Senger.)
  - writeWebGL handles lighting properly.  Based on code contributed
    by Alexander Senger.

v0.93.932
  - calling rgl.material() before any rendering caused a crash on OSX.
    (Reported by Dan Tenenbaum.)

v0.93.935
  - in certain circumstances since 0.93.930, text would fail to appear.
    (Reported by Karline Soetaert.)

v0.93.944
  - write the rgl version into the webGL file
  - cleaned up use of CHECKGLERROR, so that setting USE_GLGETERROR to 1 in
    R.h will enable detailed checking
  - added identify3d() function
  - fixed bbox bug in writeOBJ (reported by Matthias Zeeman), writePLY
    and writeSTL.
  - aspect3d() (called by plot3d()) caused the scene to be redrawn,
    even if par3d("skipRedraw") was TRUE.
  - addNormals.mesh3d() failed on objects when the matrices
    of triangles or quadrilaterals had zero columns.
  - rotate3d.mesh3d() did not transform normals properly
  - the writeWebGL() function produced fragment shaders that would not
    work in some browsers (e.g. Firefox and Chrome with the ANGLE
    WebGL engine).

v0.93.952
  - added triangulate(), polygon3d() , extrude3d() and turn3d()
     for display of shapes based on two-dimensional polygons or curves.
  - fixed formatting of vertex reference numbers in writeOBJ() (issue
    4732, reported by Alejandro Baranek).
  - added support for "headless" operation:  see help for new
    function rgl.useNULL().
  - added name of device to result returned from rgl.cur(); added function
    rgl.dev.list() to list all open devices.
  - examples and demos now check rgl.useNULL(), and don't run invisible
    animations.

v0.93.960
  - writeWebGL now forces the position attribute to location 0, a
    recommended optimization strategy.  The colour attribute is
    forced to location 1.
  - we now check for invalid characters when drawing text using bitmapped
    fonts (bug 4787)
  - gl2ps has been updated to version 1.3.8 and support for point and line
    sizes has been added (bug 4792)
  - internal functions .check3d() and rgl.select() have been exported,
    as they were used by the car package.
  - writePLY had errors writing points and lines.
  - rgl now prints a warning when a requested font is unavailable and the
    default font is substituted.

v0.93.963
  - font selection assumed rgl was on the search path; now it may be
    imported but not attached.  Similarly, r3dDefaults need not be on
    the search path.

v0.93.975
  - rgl.texts without a window failed because it queried the window
    before opening it.
  - the scene3d() function now records complete information about the
    bounding box and the background.
  - rgl declares most of its C++ objects in the global namespace.
    Recently this has caused clashes with the igraph package, which
    does the same, and which also has a Shape class.  As a temporary
    workaround the rgl class has been renamed to rglShape.  A full
    rgl namespace will eventually be added, with only the API functions
    left in the global namespace.

v0.93.984
  - most rgl C++ functions and classes are now in namespace "rgl".
    Others have prefix rgl_, with the exception of gl2ps functions,
    which all have that prefix, and FTGL functions, which generally
    have an FT prefix.
  - entry points to the rgl DLL are now registered within the DLL,
    and on systems that support it, all entry points other than the
    registration function are hidden.
  - writeWebGL() and the other write methods did not handle material
    information properly after 0.93.975.

v0.93.986
  - The FTGL functions were mistakenly added to the rgl namespace
    on some OSX compiles.
  - Changes have been made to satisfy the stringent requirements of
    the Solaris compiler.

v0.93.987
  - Added clipplanes3d function to implement clip planes.  (Still
    only partially implemented.)

v0.93.991
  - Some cleanup of the declarations (submitted by Karl Millar).

v0.93.995
  - Improved the approximation to the surface normal for degenerate
    grids in surface3d and persp3d.  (Problem found by Graham Griffiths
    using polar coordinates; all r=0 points were at the same location.)
  - The new surface normals are now saved in memory, so rgl.attrib
    will return them even if they were calculated by rgl.
  - Bounding box calculations for surfaces with user normals were
    incorrect.
  - An array-overrun bug in rgl.attrib() showed up in writeWebGL.
    (Reported by Brian Ripley.)
  - scene3d() now records light settings.

v0.93.1098
  - rgl.material() (for textures), rgl.postscript() and rgl.snapshot()
    now call normalizePath() on filenames, so tilde expansion should
    be supported.
  - par3d() could generate an error if an unnamed list was passed in.
  - material3d() lost settings for textures
  - internals are updated to be consistent with MacOS 10.9 requirements
  - fixed a bug in triangulation code:  it failed on locator() input.
  - The Aqua support now works again, XQuartz is only needed for command
    line use in Mac OSX.

v0.94
  - Added "subscenes", i.e. scenes of objects nested within the
    main window.  This affects a lot of other functions as well,
    which now act either on a single subscene or on the
    overall scene.
  - Allowed the coordinates of the viewport to be set.
  - Changed the behaviour of pop3d() and rgl.pop():  the type is
    now ignored if id is non-zero.
  - par3d("modelMatrix") no longer includes the observer translation
  - Added configurable mouse wheel actions via par3d() or
    rgl.setWheelCallback().
  - The par3d(), par3dinterp(), and spin3d() functions now
    have arguments dev and subscene to specify where they apply.
  - Included a copy of the source to CanvasMatrix.js (used by
    writeWebGL()) at the request of the Debian administrators.
  - The NULL device was not removed from the device list when
    it was closed.  (Reported by Henrik Bengtsson.)
  - Some of the animations have been sped up at the request of CRAN

0.94.1143
  - Added function methods for persp3d() and plot3d(), to allow
    surfaces to be plotted just by specifying the function.
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 0.94 that made user callbacks crash R.
    (Reported by Dave Hadka.)
  - Fixed a bug exposed in 0.94 (but really introduced in 0.93.952)
    that caused writeWebGL() to fail when a NULL device was active.
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 0.94 with writing 3D sprite objects.
  - Fixed a bug computing the bounding box of an embedded subscene.

0.95.1157
  - Allowed background of window to show bitmap;  added bgplot3d()
    and legend3d() functions.
  - Reverted misguided changes to par3d("modelMatrix") from 0.94.
    This affects rgl.projection() as well.
  - Fixed bug (introduced in 0.94) causing loss of rectangle showing
    selection area.  (Reported by John Fox and others.)
  - The NULL device now does not make any spurious OpenGL calls.

0.95.1158
  - rgl.snapshot() now works with the NULL device (but produces a
    black snapshot).  This allows testing with RGL_USE_NULL.

0.95.1196
  - writeWebGL() now includes an argument "commonParts", to allow
    omission of common code in multi-figure displays.
  - If template is NULL in writeWebGL(), no template file is used.
  - The NULL device did not handle changes to par3d("windowRect")
    properly.
  - The persp.function() method is now smarter about setting default
    axis labels.
  - The package now contains a vignette giving an overview of
    the functions.
  - Subscenes with "ignoreExtent" set to TRUE were not plotted.
  - The bounding box calculations now take clipping planes into account.
  - writeWebGL() did not display the bboxdeco properly when working
    in a subscene.
  - Added clipping regions to plot3d() and persp3d().
  - Export the GramSchmidt function (request of Remko Duursma)
  - Added readOBJ(), with a very limited ability to read OBJ
    shapefiles.
  - triangulate() now supports polygons expressed with 3
    coordinates (though they are still assumed to be planar).
  - par3d() now includes "listeners", a list of subscenes that
    respond to mouse actions in the current subscene.
  - The Windows configuration file has been modified to work in
    R-devel (to become R 3.2.0).

0.95.1247
  - If a template file is used in writeWebGL(), the string %prefix%
    will be replaced in it by the prefix argument.
  - writeWebGL() now outputs a Javascript global variable named
    "<prefix>rgl" of class "rglClass" that allows access to many of the
    scene internals.  (Inspired by patch submitted by Jeff Allen.)
  - User mouse callbacks can now be retrieved within R using
    rgl.getMouseCallbacks() and rgl.getWheelCallback(), and
    may be included in WebGL output.
  - writeWebGL() now outputs information on object ids to allow
    them to be re-used in multiple figures on the same page.
    See the "reuse" parameter and attribute of the result.
  - Started a vignette describing user interaction in WebGL.
  - Set the class of the main "canvas" element in
    writeWebGL() output to "rglWebGL".
  - rgl.snapshot() now evaluates the "top" argument after "filename"
    and "fmt", so windows created when those are evaluated don't
    overlay the rgl window.  (Suggestion of Keith Jewell.)
  - Added subsetSlider(), subsetSetter(), clipplaneSlider(),
    propertySlider(), ageSetter(), propertySetter(), par3dinterpSetter() and
    toggleButton() functions to output HTML/Javascript controls for WebGL.
  - Fixed bug in abclines3d() that caused it to skip lines that passed
    through the corners of the bounding box.  (Reported by Sven Laur.)
  - Added hook_rgl() and hook_webgl() functions, based on the knitr
    functions.

0.95.1336
  - Made error and warning text more consistent.
  - Dropped chunk option "rgl.keepopen"; replaced it
    with "rgl.newwindow".
  - Added matrixSetter() function to allow multiple controls to
    modify one matrix.
  - Added "accumulate" argument to the subset WebGL controls.
  - The "nticks" argument to bbox3d() was never used and has
    been removed.  Use "xlen", "ylen" or "zlen".
  - Setting "xlen" etc. to zero in bbox3d or rgl.bbox() now
    (correctly) suppresses tick marks. (Reported by
    Philipp Angerer.)
  - Dependencies and imports have been updated.
  - Specifying "normals" or "texcoords" in both a
    "mesh3d" object and a call to shade3d() to display
    it caused an error; now the shade3d() specified
    value has priority if "override" is TRUE (the default).
  - Added vertexSetter() function to allow easier access to
    vertex attributes.
  - Used Jeroen Ooms' js::jshints() function to clean up the
    WebGL Javascript code.
  - Allowed "values = NULL" in propertySetter() and vertexSetter()
    to allow code to directly set values.
  - When used with clipping on the bounds, persp3d() and plot3d()
    did not work properly with a shared mouse.  (Reported by
    Marian Talbert.)
  - Shaders are now stored in Javascript strings, not separate
    <script> sections.
  - Shape centers are now stored by scene3d().
  - Font family and numeric font number (style) are now returned
    by rgl.attrib() and are stored by scene3d().
  - Fixed a bug (reported by Dominick Samperi) that caused
    vignettes using WebGL code in knitr to fail to initialize
    properly.  This required adding the setupKnitr() function,
    which should be called at the start of each vignette.
    It is *not* called automatically.
  - Fixed a bug (reported by Kurt Hornik) that caused rgl to
    fail to compile when libfreetype 2.6 was linked.
  - Fixed a bug in writePLY (reported by Kurt Hornik).

0.95.1367
  - Added show2d() to allow a 2d plot on a quadrilateral
    in a scene.
  - Fixed bug that sometimes prevented textures from displaying.
  - rgl.bbox() (and hence bbox3d(), decorate3d(), plot3d(), etc.)
    did not return the correct id for the bounding box decoration.
  - Modified configure script to work with OS X 10.11 (suggestion of
    Brian Ripley).

0.95.1435
  - The Mac OS X native windowing system (aglrgl.so) has been
    dropped; it appears not to work in Yosemite and El Capitan.
  - A memory leak when drawing semi-transparent objects has been
    fixed.  (Reported by Felix Kuehnl.)
  - WebGL code has been moved to the rglwidget package (though
    the functions in rgl still work).
  - Bounding box objects sometimes had miscalculated vertices
    in scene3d().
  - If rgl.init() fails, continue with the NULL device (with warnings).
  - scene3d() now returns the normals and offsets of "planes"
    objects, as with "clipplanes" objects.  It still returns the triangles from embedding the
    planes in the most recent subscene.

0.95.1441
  - Changed rgl.pixels() to attempt to avoid segfault on
    OSX.  (Thanks to Greg Jefferis for testing and workaround.)

0.96.0
  - Gave better error when XQuartz is not found, tried for better test.
  - Added more information on backgrounds to scene3d() to allow them to be used in rglwidget().
  - Now uses forward slashes in rgl.postscript(fmt = "tex") generated code.
    (Thanks to Uwe Ligges for the problem report.)
  - Added as.mesh3d() and plot3d.deldir() and persp3d.deldir() methods to
    allow plotting of surfaces defined by irregular collections of points.
  - Background clearing was not handled properly.  (Thanks to Paul Morse
    for a bug report on this.)
  - Added rglToLattice() and rglToBase() functions to compute Euler angles
    for the lattice wireframe(), cloud(), and base graphics persp() functions. 
  - Added arrow3d() (based on the function of the same name in the
    heplots package).
  - Added pch3d() to give an approximation
to plotting symbols using pch=<number> in
base graphics.
  - Added support for control of multiple subscenes
    to spin3d(), par3dinterp(), play3d() and movie3d().
  - Added experimental function writeASY() for output in Asymptote format,
    which will allow inclusion in PDF files.
  - cylinder3d() now defaults to a rotation minimizing local frame.
  - Added this NEWS file
  - Added better support for backgrounds
  - Added support for orthographic projections (FOV = 0)
  - Added simple Shiny demo using tabs
  - Fixed bug in rendering unlit 3D sprites
  - Added version dependency for jsonlite so that the
    new faster matrix code will be used.
  - Added rgl.attrib.info() to display information about
    object attributes.
  - Merged rglwidget code back into rgl.
  - Functions that modify the scene now return their
    value with class "rglLowlevel" or "rglHighlevel" (using the new lowlevel()
    or highlevel() functions) to indicate that a low- or high-level plotting function
    has been called.  If the new option 
    "rgl.printRglwidget" is TRUE, printing objects
    of either class will trigger automatic
    printing of the rgl scene using rglwidget().
  - Web browsers only support a finite number of active
    WebGL sessions; rglwidget code now works to make more
    careful use of this finite resource, so that large
    numbers of rgl scenes can be present on a single
    web page without exhausting it.
  - The worker functions used by subdivision3d() have
    been exported for use on their own.
  - The rglwidget code now supports textures on spheres.  
    It now uses the same mesh as the one used inside R. 
    (The lack of support was pointed out by Justin McManus.)
    
0.97.0
  - Fixed bug in conversion of bounding box decorations
    used in rglwidget().
  - Added "fixedSize" argument to rgl.sprites() and related
    functions.
  - Added plotmath3d() function, and set text3d() to
    use it when necessary.
  - addNormals() gave an error if the mesh it was working
    with had degenerate triangles or quads.  (Reported
    by Rolf Turner and Graham Griffiths.)
  - Auto-clipping sometimes changed result vectors into
    lists.
  - The controllers did not recycle some values correctly.
  - Fixed bug in initialization of playwidgets.
  - material3d() now silently ignores attempts to set
    read-only properties.
  - Added setUserShaders() for user-specified shaders
    (currently for WebGL only).
  - Added support for two-sided surfaces in WebGL.
  - Fixed some bugs in pch3d() (reported by Gina Joue).
  - Added demo("rglExamples") to display all the examples
    in the rgl help in a collection of web pages.
    This showed up a number of small bugs, which have been
    fixed.
  - movie3d() now optionally tries the R "magick" package first,
    then the external ImageMagick v7 command "magick" 
    before trying "convert".  (The external change
    suggested by Earl F. Glynn.)
  - par3d() reports on the version of OpenGL that it sees
    (as component "glVersion").

0.98.1
  - Cleaned up configure script.
  - Cleaned up dynamic entry points.
  - Added "add = FALSE" argument to persp3d.deldir().
  - layout3d() handled multi-row cells incorrectly.  (Reported
    by Felix Carbonell.)
  - Fixed a bug in subsetControl(), and added
    toggleWidget()
  - Renamed the "texture" argument to persp3d.function()
    to "texcoords" for consistency with other functions, and
    to avoid a collision with the "texture" material property.
  - "shiny.tag" objects are now supported as inputs to
    playwidget(), so that rglwidget() values can be 
    wrapped in htmltools::div() to set their style.
  - Fixed bug in scene initialization that sometimes caused it
    to ignore initial control values.
  - Added figWidth() and figHeight() functions for sizing
    rgl plots in R Markdown documents.
    
0.98.22
  - Record context (ioslides, shiny, etc.) in scene 
    when rglwidget() is called.
  - Allow more than 16 scenes in html_document, ioslides_presentation and
    slidy_presentation.
  - useSubscene3d() now returns the id of the previously active subscene,
    to make temporary changes more convenient.
  - The rendering order is changed:  now all opaque objects are drawn first,
    then all transparent objects.  Previously this ordering was only done
    within subscenes, leading to rendering errors when transparent objects
    in one subscene were drawn before opaque objects in another.
  - renderRglwidget() and renderPlaywidget() now have an optional argument
    outputArgs for use in dynamic R Markdown documents.
  - rglwidget() now warns if an object has too many vertices
  - transparent spheres sometimes showed rendering
    artifacts because they were not drawn from back to front.  (Reported by Atte Tenkanen; original fix improved so nested
    spheres should now work.  WebGL display could still be
    improved.)
  - par3dinterp() did not always choose the best direction for interpolation
    of the userMatrix.
  - added an approximation to "polar" mouse controls to WebGL display.
  - the "centers" attribute now refers to the individual facets
    of spheres, rather than the whole sphere.  Use "vertices" for
    that.
  - The togglewidget() function didn't work properly in Shiny.
  - Tried to give a more helpful startup error message on MacOS.
  - Added documentation to rglwidgetClass in Javascript.
  - vertexSetter() can now set plane parameters.
  - Modified platform.cpp so it works with __STRICT_ANSI__
    defined.
  - Fixed addition of attribute to NULL
  - Fixed bug where textures or normals caused readOBJ() to fail;
    added support for reading normals and texture coordinates.
  - As many browsers have dropped support for setting line width 
    in WebGL scenes, this has been redone in rglwidget() 
    code using a vertex shader.  
    Line endings and joins are rounded, not squared as in OpenGL.
  - The 65535 vertex limit has been removed (at least in browsers
    that support big indices).
  - The requirement that colours being controlled by an ageControl or vertexControl
    be duplicated in the original has been removed.
  - axes3d("bbox") didn't send parameters to bbox3d().
  - Fixed examples for snapshot3d() and writeASY() so that they don't
    change the working directory.
    
0.99.9
  - Christophe Geuzaine's GL2PS library (used by rgl.postscript())
    updated to version 1.4.0.
  - Added support for communication with other widgets
    using the crosstalk package. See ?rglShared and the
    WebGL vignette for details.
  - Added the rglMouse() function to allow the mouse
    mode to be changed in a WebGL display.
  - Fixed a bug causing the rglwidget() to fail to work
    in a flexdashboard display.
  - Fixed a bug in Shiny interaction
  - Changed WebGL text rendering to avoid overloading
    browser.
  - The pandoc system requirement has been updated to
    1.14, as 1.13.1 is no longer sufficient.
  - Sphere rendering within R sometimes showed strange
    artifacts.
    
0.99.16
  - Minor fixups to the vignettes.
  - Now uses the manipulateWidget::combineWidgets function
    when putting multiple objects into a pipe.
  - Now accepts fixed CSS units in width and height for rglwidgets.
  - playwidget() is no longer an S3 generic function.
  - Textures specified in global material list (e.g. by being
    used in rgl.* functions) were not handled properly.
    (Reported by Ty Tuff.)
  - The configure code to detect freetype has been updated
    to use pkg-config (code contributed by Dirk Eddelbuettel.)
  - If a playwidget() has been initialized but it can't find
    the rglwidget() that it is controlling (likely due to a 
    typo somewhere), it now throws an alert message.
