Notes on shader branch:

Text is not being displayed properly, maybe because FTGL isn't
updating in the new framework.

These steps happen when drawing a quad with useShaders:

  Initialization:
    sets vertices and indices
  DrawBegin:
    starts to use the vertexArray
    starts to use the material
  DrawRange:
    calls glDrawArrays or glDrawElements
    
These steps happen when drawing text:

  Initialization:
    same, plus some other variables
    fonts are FTGLPixmapFont objects, which are really
      FTPixmapFont objects
  DrawBegin:
    start to use the material
  DrawPrimitive:
    call glRasterPos, glGetBooleanv (for validity),
    asks the font to draw the text.
    The drawing happens around FTPixmapFont.cpp:98 .
    
    
    
Using lldb: glBegin is being called by AxisInfo::draw to draw
the ticks.
