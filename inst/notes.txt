Notes on shader branch:

Text is being displayed using the old OpenGL 1.x
fixed function scheme.  This will stop us from
being able to update to OpenGL 3.x or higher
without updating FTGL or switching to a
different library.

These steps happen when drawing a quad with useShaders:

  Initialization:
    sets vertices and indices
  DrawBegin:
    starts to use the vertexArray
    starts to use the material
  DrawRange:
    calls glDrawArrays or glDrawElements
    
These steps happen when drawing text:

  Initialization:
    same, plus some other variables
    fonts are FTGLPixmapFont objects, which are really
      FTPixmapFont objects
  DrawBegin:
    start to use the material
  DrawPrimitive:
    call glRasterPos, glGetBooleanv (for validity),
    asks the font to draw the text.
    The drawing happens around FTPixmapFont.cpp:98 .
    
    
    
Using lldb: glBegin is being called by AxisInfo::draw to draw
the ticks.
