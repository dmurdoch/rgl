Plans for updates:

 - Handle text finally (see shaders vignette and ftglnotes.txt)
 - Possibly use ragg as a model for drawing text to a bitmap
 which will then be used as a texture.  It uses textshaping
 and systemfonts.
 - Possibly use cairo graphics.  rasterText package is
 an experiment in that.
   - Modify drawToBitmap to work with rasterText functions.
   - Font fallbacks will only be supported in R; C functions
     will assume all fonts are specified properly.  This may
     need a way to say "string 1 followed by string 2 on the
     same line, treated as one big string for centering"
 - Read and update docs
 - Test and fix until everything is covered.
 
 - Think about this idea:  given a particular view of a scene,
 items are sorted from front to back.  But in many cases items
 have a range of depths, and the ranges overlap.  Approach:
 if two items overlap, split each into pieces, and consider 
 the pieces.  Splits could be natural splits depending on
 the object, or intersections with splits of the screen.  (The
 latter would mean potentially fewer objects to worry about.)


Notes on shader branch:

Text is being displayed using the old OpenGL 1.x
fixed function scheme.  This will stop us from
being able to update to OpenGL 3.x or higher
without updating FTGL or switching to a
different library.

2D sprites are not working yet, maybe because 
the offset (aOfs) attribute isn't being set.  Where
should that happen?

These steps happen when drawing a quad with useShaders:

  Initialization:
    sets vertices and indices
  DrawBegin:
    starts to use the vertexArray
    starts to use the material
  DrawRange:
    calls glDrawArrays or glDrawElements
    
These steps happen when drawing text:

  Initialization:
    same, plus some other variables
    fonts are FTGLPixmapFont objects, which are really
      FTPixmapFont objects
  DrawBegin:
    start to use the material
  DrawPrimitive:
    call glRasterPos, glGetBooleanv (for validity),
    asks the font to draw the text.
    The drawing happens around FTPixmapFont.cpp:98 .
    
    
    
Using lldb: glBegin is being called by AxisInfo::draw to draw
the ticks.
