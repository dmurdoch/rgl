Notes for pkgdown branch

To build website:

 setwd("~/svn/MyR/rgl")
 pkgdown::init_site()
 pkgdown::build_site(install = FALSE) # , new_process = FALSE)

If used with the rglpatch branches of pkgdown and downlit, this
installs divs for the rgl output.

It currently includes an after-head.html template that fixes the
scripts needed by examples:  this is a horrible hack.  What it 
should do is collect dependencies as the output is being
displayed, and insert the dependencies needed in the particular
example, not everything.  evaluate_and_highlight will need
to be involved in this, because it will see the dependencies.

It also needs to distinguish between high level and low level
plots; this likely needs pkgdown changes to its call to evaluate_and_highlight.
