Notes for pkgdown branch

To build website:

 setwd("~/svn/MyR/rgl")
 pkgdown::init_site()
 pkgdown::build_site(install = FALSE) # , new_process = FALSE)

If used with the rglpatch branches of pkgdown and downlit, this
installs divs for the rgl output, but doesn't install the
scripts to run them.  I think that should go into a template.  
Not sure yet how to make that happen automatically.
