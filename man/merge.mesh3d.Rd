\title{
Merge \code{"mesh3d"} objects.
}
\description{
Attempts to merge \code{"mesh3d"} objects.  Objects need
to be similar enough; see Details.
}
\usage{
\method{merge}{mesh3d}(x, y, ..., attributesMustMatch = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x, y}{
\code{"mesh3d"} objects to merge.
}
  \item{\dots}{
Optional additional objects.
}
  \item{attributesMustMatch}{ See Details.}
}
\details{
To allow objects to be merged, they need to be similar enough
in terms of having the same list of material properties,
normals, texture coordinates, etc.  

If \code{attributesMustMatch} is \code{TRUE}, it is an error
to have attributes in one mesh but not in another, and 
those attributes that only specify a single value must have equal
values in all meshes.

If \code{attributesMustMatch} is \code{FALSE}, any non-matching
attributes will be dropped from the final result.
}
\value{
A single \code{"mesh3d"} object merging the contents
of the arguments.
