\details{
  These functions create and work with \code{mesh3d} objects, which consist of a matrix
  of vertex coordinates together with a matrix of indices indicating which vertex is
  part of which face.  Such objects may have  triangular faces,
  planar quadrilateral faces, or both.

  The sample objects optionally take a matrix transformation \code{trans} as 
  an argument.  This transformation is applied to all vertices of the default shape.
  The default is an identity transformation. 
  
  The \code{"shape3d"} class is a general class for shapes that can be plotted
  by \code{dot3d}, \code{wire3d} or \code{shade3d}.
  
  The \code{"mesh3d"} class is a class of objects that form meshes: the vertices
  are in member \code{vb}, as a 3 or 4 by \code{n} matrix.  Meshes with triangular
  faces will contain \code{it}, a \code{3 * n} matrix giving the indices of the 
  vertices in each face.  Quad meshes will have vertex indices in \code{ib},
  a \code{4 * n} matrix.  Individual meshes may have both types
  of faces.
  
  The \code{meshColor} argument controls how material colours and textures are interpreted.  This parameter
was added in \pkg{rgl} version 0.100.1 (0.100.27 for \code{dot3d}, \code{tmesh3d} and \code{qmesh3d}; 0.102.19
for textures).  Possible values are:
\describe{
\item{\code{"vertices"}}{Colours and texture coordinates are applied by vertex, in the order
they appear in the \code{vb} matrix.}
\item{\code{"edges"}}{Colours and textures are applied to each edge:  first to the
3 edges of each triangle in the \code{it} matrix, then the 4
edges of each quad in the \code{ib} matrix.  This mode
is only supported if both front and back materials are
\code{"lines"}.}
\item{\code{"faces"}}{Colours and textures are applied to each face:  first to the
triangles in the \code{it} matrix, then to the quads in the \code{ib}
matrix.}
\item{\code{"legacy"}}{Colours and textures are applied in the same way
as in \pkg{rgl} versions earlier than 0.100.1.}
}
Unique partial matches of these values will be recognized.

If colours are specified but \code{meshColor} is not
and \code{options(rgl.meshColorWarning = TRUE)},
a warning will be given that their
interpretation may have changed.  In versions 0.100.1 to 0.100.26
of \pkg{rgl}, the default
was to give the warning; now the default is for no warning.

Note that since version 0.102.10, \code{meshColor = 
"edges"} is only allowed when drawing lines (the
\code{wire3d} default), and it may draw
edges more than once.  In general, if any rendering
draws twice at the same location, which copy is visible 
depends on the order of drawing and the
\code{\link{material3d}("depth_test")}
setting.

\value{
  \code{qmesh3d}, \code{cube3d}, \code{oh3d}, \code{tmesh3d},
  \code{tetrahedron3d}, \code{octahedron3d}, \code{icosahedron3d} and
  \code{dodecahedron3d} return objects of class \code{c("mesh3d",
  "shape3d")}.  The first three of these are quad meshes, the rest are
  triangle meshes.
  
  \code{dot3d}, \code{wire3d}, and \code{shade3d} are called for their side effect
  of drawing an object into the scene; they return an object ID (or vector of IDs, for some 
  classes) invisibly.
  
  See \code{\link{rgl.primitive}} for a discussion of texture coordinates.
