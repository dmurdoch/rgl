# 1.3.23

This release fixes some minor bugs, and one R-crashing bug.

It also fixes links from help pages to vignettes and 
vice versa.

There are no CRAN check issues other than the size, and
that's only on MacOS.  I believe it's because that
platform retains debug info.

I haven't run a full revdep check, but on a 10% random 
sample no issues came up.  Since there are no API
changes, that's not a surprise.
