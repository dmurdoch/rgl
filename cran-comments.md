# 1.3.34

This is mostly a small update requested by CRAN to fix
some links in one of the vignettes.  It also contains some
small bug fixes.  

The largest change is that some functions that
were marked deprecated have been made defunct.  Package
maintainers were notified about this change on Jan 10. 
As far as I can see, the following packages have not made
any change to drop the use of the now-defunct functions:

  SimCop, gifti, nat.nblast, radviz3d
  
These have updated:

  cifti, hyperoverlap, msir
