## What is the problem?

[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is an R package that
makes it easy to build a web site for your package.  However, the current version 1.6.1 on CRAN doesn't work so well for
packages whose examples use RGL or other packages like [leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) that use
[htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org).  This document
describes current progress in supporting both of these.

The main problem for [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) support
is that RGL and other [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org)
users require multiple Javascript libraries to be linked to
each web page.  `pkgdown` 1.6.1 can't do this, but the 
current development version on Github
adds support for additional dependent libraries.  This 
also requires changes to [downlit](https://downlit.r-lib.org/), and
for other widgets, [changes to htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets/pull/404).

## Installing the changes

Installing the changes is fairly easy.  Make sure you have the
[remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) package installed, then 
run

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(c("r-lib/downlit",
                          "r-lib/pkgdown",
                          "dmurdoch/htmlwidgets@rglpatch"))
```

With these development version packages installed, you should 
see RGL or `leaflet` output appear automatically in examples.
The RGL output is set up to mimic what would happen in a
`knitr` document that uses 
```{r eval=FALSE}
setupKnitr(autoprint = TRUE)
```
i.e. the output RGL commands will automatically be 
included in the display.  Low-level changes will be collected
into a single display:
```{r}
# Show regression plane with z as dependent variable
library(rgl)
open3d()
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
z <- 0.2*x - 0.3*y + rnorm(100, sd = 0.3)
fit <- lm(z ~ x + y)

plot3d(x, y, z, type = "s", col = "red", size = 1)

# No plot here, because of the planes3d() call below

coefs <- coef(fit)
a <- coefs["x"]
b <- coefs["y"]
c <- -1
d <- coefs["(Intercept)"]
planes3d(a, b, c, d, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Specifying the size of figures

By default, pkgdown generates standard plots which are wider
than they are high (according to the golden ratio).  Often
RGL plots look better with equal width and height, since
the contents may be rotated by the user.

To specify the size of plots in pkgdown, you use the `figures`
entry in `_pkgdown.yml`.  The defaults are similar to
```
figures:
  dev: ragg::agg_png
  dpi: 96
  dev.args: []
  fig.ext: png
  fig.width: 7
  fig.height: ~
  fig.retina: 2
  fig.asp: 1.618
  bg: NA
  other.parameters: []
```

By default RGL uses these parameters as well, but allows you 
to override any of `fig.width`, `fig.height` and `fig.asp` by
specifying an `rgl` entry in `other.parameters`.  For example:
```
figures:
  fig.width: 5
  other.parameters:
    rgl:
      fig.asp: 1
```
This will make all plots have a width of 5 inches
and will make RGL plots square.

## Is this safe to use?

These are development versions of the packages, so they may
contain bugs, either in my changes or in other unreleased 
changes.  I don't recommend you use them in regular production
code.  To re-install released versions of the packages, run
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("downlit", "pkgdown", "htmlwidgets", "rgl"))
```

If you do use them and notice any bugs, please [report them](https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl/issues)!
