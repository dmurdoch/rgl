If you want to report a bug, you are in the right place!

If you need help or have a question, please ask on [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
Include tags `[r]` and `[rgl]` and you'll likely get help 
quickly.

You can test whether your bug has already been fixed by running

    remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl")

but the install may fail, as `rgl` can be hard to build.  If so,
please test on the latest CRAN release.

If you've still got problems, please include code that demonstrates the bug and keep it short and simple.
